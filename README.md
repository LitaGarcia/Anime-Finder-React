# Best Anime Finder Ever (Now with React)
This is a personal repo to test React with the functionalities of the last evaluation made with vanilla Js

## New functionality!
I have used a new dependency "uuid" to give each Anime an unique ID.

## Where is the Fetch and API?
I'm testing with a personal homemade data.JSON to fetch the elements. The data is the same as the [api](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/) used in the last evaluation, the data includes also the images.
